# ETH Course Guide

This site is created for sharing course materials and learning experiences in ETH Zurich. All materials are contributed **by the community**.

Under every page there is a **discussion system**, where everyone is welcome to share experiences and feelings about individual courses. 

Hopefully all these information can help ETH students in course selecting, learning and exam preparing.

You can browse courses by department in the leftside list, or find your course using the search bar.
